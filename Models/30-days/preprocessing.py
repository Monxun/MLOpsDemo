# ### Observations:
# 
# - Train set has 300,000 rows while test set has 200,000 rows.
# - There are 10 categorical features from `cat0` - `cat9` and 14 continuous features from `cont0` - `cont13`.
# - There is no missing values in the train and test dataset but there is no category `G` in `cat6` test dataset.
# - Categorical features ranging from alphabet A - O but it varies from each categorical feature with `cat0`, `cat1`, `cat3`, `cat5` and `cat6` are dominated by one category.
# - Continuous features on train anda test dataset ranging from -0.1 to 1.25 which are a multimodal distribution and they resemble each other.
# - target has a range between 6.8 to 10.5 and has a bimodal distribution.
# 
# 
# Ideas:
# 
# Drop features that are dominated by one category cat0, cat1, cat3, cat5 and cat6 as they don't give variation to the dataset but further analysis still be needed.

# Now, we'll need to handle the categorical columns (`cat0`, `cat1`, ... `cat9`).  
# 
# From the lesson **[Categorical Variables lesson](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/categorical-variables)**, we'll use ordinal encoding and save our encoded features as new variables `X` and `X_test`.
# 
# #### What is Ordinal Encoder and why we choose it?
# In ordinal encoding, each unique category value is assigned an integer value. The encoding involves mapping each unique label to an integer value.
# For example, `red` is 1, `green` is 2, and `blue` is 3.
# 
# This is called an ordinal encoding or an integer encoding and is easily reversible. Often, integer values starting at zero are used. The integer values have a natural ordered relationship between each other and machine learning algorithms may be able to understand and harness this relationship.
# 
# There are three common approaches for converting categorical variables to numerical values. They are:
# 
# - Ordinal Encoding
# - One-Hot Encoding
# - Dummy Variable Encoding
# 
# But in here, we are using Ordinal because our dataset is naturally in order, alphabetically. Hence, when we encode it, the converted numerics consequently take a natural integral order like in its original form. Take a note of that in the following table. 
# 
# _Eg: 'A' -> 0.0, 'B' -> 1.0, 'C' -> 2.0,, and so on..._
# 
# But for categorical variables, where no such ordinal relationship exist, it may be advisable to use the other two. Nevertheless, for this dataset, ordinal encoding will suffice. But you can definitely use other encoding approaches as well.

# We can also prepare the target in the same manner. Ordinal encoding of target variable uses LabelEncoder(). But we do not use it here since it is used to normalize labels, and to transform non-numerical labels (as long as they are hashable and comparable) to numerical labels. Since our target is already numeric, we do not need it here.

# # Step 5: Train a model
# 
# Now that the data is prepared, the next step is to train a model.  
# 
# ## âœ” 5.1: Random Forest
# 
# From the lesson **[Random Forests](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests)**, we learnt how to fit a random forest model to the data.
# 
# #### What is Random Forest, and why are we using it here?
# 
# Random forest is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble methods (bagging) to solve both regression and classification problems. The algorithm operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the mean/mode of prediction of the individual trees.
# 
# - Each tree is created from a different sample of rows and at each node, a different sample of features is selected for splitting. 
# - Each of the trees makes its own individual prediction. 
# - These predictions are then averaged to produce a single result. 
# 
# ![Random Forest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Random_forest_diagram_complete.png)
# 
# The averaging makes a Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree hence improves its accuracy and reduces overfitting. 
# 
# A prediction from the Random Forest Regressor is an average of the predictions produced by the trees in the forest.

# But when the Random Forest Regressor is tasked with the problem of predicting for values not previously seen, it will always predict an average of the values seen previously. Meaning, that the Random Forest Regressor is unable to discover trends that would enable it in extrapolating values that fall outside the training set. 
# 
# The random forest performs implicit feature selection because it splits nodes on the most important variables, but other machine learning models do not. One approach to improve the models is therefore to use the random forest feature importances to reduce the number of variables in the problem. In our case, we will use the feature importances to decrease the number of features for our random forest model, because, in addition to potentially increasing performance, reducing the number of features will shorten the run time of the model. Let's see if it improves the accuracy of our model.

# 
# From the lesson **[XGBoost](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/xgboost)**, we learnt how to fit a XGBoost model to the data.
# 
# #### What is XGBoost?
# XGBoost is termed as Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm which is again an ensemble method that works by boosting trees. XGboost makes use of a gradient descent algorithm which is the reason that it is called Gradient Boosting. The whole idea is to correct the previous mistake done by the model, learn from it and its next step improves the performance. The previous results are rectified and performance is enhanced.
# 
# ![XGBoost Regressor](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*FLshv-wVDfu-i54OqvZdHg.png)
# 
# #### Why is it preferred?
# - Speed and perfoermance: Comparatively faster than other ensemble classifiers
# - Core algorithm is parallelizable: Because the core XGBoost algorithm is parallelizable it can harness the power of multi-core computers. It is also parallelizable onto GPUâ€™s and across networks of computers making it feasible to train on very large datasets as well.
# - Consistently outperforms other algorithm methods : It has shown better performance on a variety of machine learning benchmark datasets.
# - Wide variety of tuning parameters : XGBoost internally has parameters for cross-validation, regularization, user-defined objective functions, missing values, tree parameters, scikit-learn compatible API etc.

# ## âœ” 5.3: LightGBM
# 
# Light GBM is a fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithm, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. Since it is based on decision tree algorithms, it splits the tree leaf wise with the best fit whereas other boosting algorithms split the tree depth wise or level wise rather than leaf-wise. So when growing on the same leaf in Light GBM, the leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than the level-wise algorithm and hence results in much better accuracy which can rarely be achieved by any of the existing boosting algorithms. Also, it is surprisingly very fast, hence the word â€˜Lightâ€™.
# 
# ![LightGBM](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*mKkwlQF25Rq1ilne5UiEXA.png)
# 
# #### Advantages of Light GBM
# - Faster training speed and higher efficiency: Light GBM use histogram based algorithm i.e it buckets continuous feature values into discrete bins which fasten the training procedure.
# - Lower memory usage: Replaces continuous values to discrete bins which result in lower memory usage.
# - Better accuracy than any other boosting algorithm: It produces much more complex trees by following leaf wise split approach rather than a level-wise approach which is the main factor in achieving higher accuracy. However, it can sometimes lead to overfitting which can be avoided by setting the max_depth parameter.
# - Compatibility with Large Datasets: It is capable of performing equally good with large datasets with a significant reduction in training time as compared to XGBOOST.
# - Parallel learning supported.

# ## âœ” 5.4: CatBoost
# CatBoost is an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees. And it is the only boosting algorithm with very less prediction time. Because of its symmetric tree structure. It is comparatively 8x faster than XGBoost while predicting. One main difference between CatBoost and other boosting algorithms is that the CatBoost implements symmetric trees. Though when datasets have many numerical features (like this one), CatBoost takes so much time to train than Light GBM.
# 
# But CatBoost also offers an idiosyncratic way of handling categorical data, requiring a minimum of categorical feature transformation, opposed to the majority of other machine learning algorithms, that cannot handle non-numeric values. From a feature engineering perspective, the transformation from a non-numeric state to numeric values can be a very non-trivial and tedious task, and CatBoost makes this step obsolete. (Though here, we had used feature engineering for conducting training in all the models)

# #### Why are we using only one of the models of each regressor to check the most important features for those models?
# That's because the feature importances depend on the models, not on the parameters. We can check with any variations of the parameters for each of the regressors.
# 
# # Step 7: Submit to the competition
# 
# We'll begin by using the trained model to generate predictions, which we'll save to a CSV file.
# 
# ### But which model to use for prediction?
# 
# Maybe we should try to use all of the models we trained! Here is a fun way to put weightage to the predictions of all the models to get the final outcome. 
# 
# *NOTE:* Remember to put more weightage on the models with lesser RMSE value to get the best result. 
# 
# ### Ensemble
# Try ensembling. Using model blending weights optimisation technique similar to the one used in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/gogo827jz/optimise-blending-weights-with-bonus-0) notebook, we have tried it on our models. Ensembling different models can be necessary to improve scores.

# # Step 8: Extras
# 
# A few of the linear regression models were further used for experimentation:
# 
# - **Linear Regression** : Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).
# - **Ridge Regression** : Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. 
# - **LASSO Regression** : Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters).
# - **Elastic Net** : It is a linear regression model trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer. This combination allows for learning a sparse model where few of the weights are non-zero like Lasso, while still maintaining the regularization properties of Ridge.
# - **Stochastic Gradient Descent** : Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used in machine learning applications to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs.
# 
# But the RMSE scores from these were much higher compared to the previous models used in this notebook, so it was not used for the final submission.
